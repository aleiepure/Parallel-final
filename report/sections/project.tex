This report is the result of a collaborative effort between the authors. All decisions %
were discussed, agreed on and developed together. Each author focussed mainly on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lorenzo Fasol}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sequential version
            \item OpenMP version
            \item CUDA version
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alessandro Iepure}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sequential version
            \item MPI version
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Riccardo Minella}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sequential version
            \item OpenMP version
            \item MPI version
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The report was co-authored by all of us. All source codes for the various algorithm %
implementations, along with the scripts used for the experiments and other assets, %
are available in the project's GitHub repository at the following link %
\url{https://github.com/aleiepure/Parallel-final}. The repository also contains %
a PDF copy of this document and the \LaTeX{} source code.
